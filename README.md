# IYPT-Team-India-Tennis-Ball-Tower-Stability-Unity-Simulation
Official Unity C# code for simulating deformable tennis balls stacked like a tower for 2022 IYPT by Team India


Open File in Unity hub and add balls with the inbuilt system to automate their coordinates for the required structure. 
Then using the wind added, see at what speed of wind the tower breaks, and the pressure texture also shows you the force distribution.
